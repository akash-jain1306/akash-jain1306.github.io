## About Me

I am currently pursuing my M.S. under Dr. Balaraman Ravindran and co-guided by Dr. Rupesh Nasre at IIT Madras. I joined IIT Madras in July 2015. My area of research is Machine Learning and Distributed Graph Processing Frameworks for Complex Network Analysis. I am working on community detection algorithms for distributed graph processing frameworks (i.e. GraphX, GofFish) to figure out structural patterns in the dynamic graphs.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/akash-jain1306/akash-jain1306.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
