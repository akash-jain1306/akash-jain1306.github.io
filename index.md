<title> Akash Jain </title> # About Me

I am currently pursuing my M.S. under Dr. Balaraman Ravindran and co-guided by Dr. Rupesh Nasre at IIT Madras. I joined IIT Madras in July 2015. My area of research is Machine Learning and Distributed Graph Processing Frameworks for Complex Network Analysis. I am working on community detection algorithms for distributed graph processing frameworks (i.e. GraphX, GofFish) to figure out structural patterns in the dynamic graphs.
